# Pose-Abberation-Computation
This project determines the spatial geometrical computation to analyze the human correct and wrong body posture abberation. Used distance vector formulae to find the 
distance between the landmarks and subsequently used the arctan2 and 3d-vector angle formule to compute the angle between the ROIs.
